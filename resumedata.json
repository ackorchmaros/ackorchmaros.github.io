    "description":"For the last nine months I have been actively working on two projects in the applied non linear algebra group at Aalto. In my main project, I have been working in reconstructing the 3D DNA structure of diploid organisms using algebraic geometry and polynomial optimization techniques. I have been also working on estimating the dimensionality of the neuronal manifold in mice using an algebraic geometry approach. As side project I have been studying the structure of 2-colored best match graphs.",

    "bio":"Thank you for checking out my website. I have a master and doctoral degree in mathematics, and I am particularly interested in applying graph theory, algebraic geometry, and statistics to address issues in neuroscience and genetics. After finishing my doctoral degree, I moved to the US where I graduated with a master in bioinformatics and worked as neuroimaging data analyst for a year. I relocated to Finland to start a post doctorate in mathematics in December 2019, and I have been working in applied non linear algebra and graph theory. Outside work I love spending time with friends and family, meditating, cycling, doing pilates, hiking, and all kind of outdoor activities.",
